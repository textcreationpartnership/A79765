         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now deare Brethren, although we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of you through the Lord, that you neither are, nor will be otherwiſe minded then to ſtand faſt in the truth of Chriſt, and to be faithfull to the death in the Covenant you have taken: yet give us leave to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance. That whereto you and we have already attained, there may bee a walking by the ſame rule, and minding of the ſame thing.</p>

The Doctrinall part of Church-Government agreed upon by the reverend &amp; learned Aſſembly of Divines was at the ſame time with the <hi>Directory</hi> of worſhip ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the generall Aſſembly and ratified by the Parliament of this Kingdome, the <hi>Confeſsion of Faith</hi> is alſo approved by the laſt generall Aſſembly as ſound and orthodoxe for the matter, and agreed unto on their part, that it be a part of the uniformity and a Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith for the Churches of Chriſt in the three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>The other things communicated from thence unto this Church, namely a <hi>Directory</hi> of Church Government Cateiſme, and new paraphraſe of the Pſalms in metre are printed and publiſhed here, to be conſidred and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined againſt the next generall Aſſembly to be held in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1648, we wiſh and hope that you all may ſtand faſt and firme together in the ſame principles &amp; rules, and that theſe reſults of ſo long and learned Syndiocall debates may generally find acceptance through tho Kingdome; It cannot be expected that ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as is according to the mind of Chriſt, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the caſting out of <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdome, to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of prophanneſſe, and ſuppreſſing of errours and hereſie, can be carried on without a mighty and ſtrong oppoſition: But how ſtrong ſoever the oppoſition be, it is but the ſtrength of <hi>Satan</hi> and wicked men; the weapons of your warre farre (if well handled) are more ſtrong and mighty through God to the caſting downe of every thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt: The eyes of God, Angells, and Man, are now in a more ſpeciall manner upon you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how to acquit your ſelves in this time of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>

Bleſſed ſhall they be whoſoever ſhall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the covenant and cauſe of Chriſt, but ſhall bee ready to ſpeake, doe or ſuffer for it, whatſoever God calleth them unto; and ſhall neither be aſhamed of it when it is ſet aſide and abandoned by many, nor afraid to own it, and to give a good and honeſt Teſtimony for it, even when it is oppoſed and perſecuted.</p>
            <p>We know your temptations are many and great, yet ſuch as God hath in his word forewarned you of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing withall that with your temptation; he will make a way to eſcape that ye may be able to beare it: Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is he who hath called you, who alſo will doe it. When you are preſſed out of meaſure and above ſtrength, it is that you ſhould not truſt to your ſelves but to God; So that when you are weak then are you ſtrong, and when the adverſaries of truth are ſtrong, then are they weak. Be it therefore far from you, to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the tentations either on the right hand by compliance, and doing evill that good may come of it, or on the left, by a deſpendency of ſpirit, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away of your confidence, which as we truſt you will not; ſo if any among you ſhould, there wil be cauſe to ſay to him as once it was ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> Behold thou haſt inſtructed many, and ſtrengthened the weake hands. Thy words have upholden him that was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the feeble knees: But now it is come upon thee and thou fainteſt, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. It is indeed the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian world, that after ſuch a Solemne Covenant for extirpation of hereſie and ſchiſme, theſe pernicious plants have been ſuffered to ſpread more then ever before.</p>
            <p>Tis alſo a ſtupendious judgement of God that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161349:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 82 -->horne ſhould grow forth, and wax great, and have an hoſt given it againſt the daily ſacrifice by reaſon of tranſgreſſion, yea, to caſt downe the truth to the ground, practiſeing and proſpering, and even by peace deſtroying many. Such things God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted long agoe, yet but for a time, having pre-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited a certaine period thereunto. Truth was at laſt victorious and ſo ſhall be. Meane while the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more horrid the preſent evills be, tis the more neceſſary for you, and you have the clearer call from God to give teſtimony againſt them and the greater were the ſinne and danger if you ſhould not: But we are the more confident that you ſhall not fall under this ſinne and danger, becauſe you have already by your Sermons and Writings ſo much witneſſed for the truth, and againſt the errours of theſe times. This we muſt further ſay from our owne experience, that faithfull indeavours of theſe who were both few and weake, in the greateſt extremities, and in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties appeared moſt in-ſuperable, have not wanted a bleſſing and comfortable ſucceſſe. God can as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily drive all the monſterous Errours and Hereſies out of <hi>England,</hi> as once he tooke away all the locuſts out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a mighty ſtrong weſt wind, ſo that there remained not one locuſt in all the coaſts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> God can make the earth to open, her mouth and ſwallow up the flood which the Dragon caſt out of his mouth: it is not in vaine in the worſt of times to bee witneſſes for Chriſt and for his truth, to do duty and truſt God with events. As many as walke according to this rule, and will yet ſincerely conſtantly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour that by their Covenant they are bound to do, ſhall find that their labour is not in vaine in the

            <p>And for our part you are in our hearts to dye and live with you, and we ceaſe not to make mention of you in our prayers daily: beleeving alſo that God hath thoughts of peace towards you and not of evill, to give you an expected end; and that when he hath humbled his people under his mighty hand, and brought them to an acknowledgment of thoſe offences which are the true cauſes of his controverſie, he will awake for their helpe, and appeare for their joy; And then they who are by a temporary ſucceſſe hardned in wayes of errour or malignancy, ſhall ſee it and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and ſhall wonder and periſh, but peace ſhall be upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
